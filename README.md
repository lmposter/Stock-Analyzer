# Stock Analyzer

## Description:
The Stock Analyzer is a Python-based application designed to assist users in making informed investment decisions in the stock market. The project leverages a dataset of stock information obtained from Yahoo Finance and utilizes various algorithms to compute scores for each stock based on factors such as value, growth, quality, consistency, risk, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), and dividend. These scores are then used to recommend optimal stocks to users based on their preferences.

The project consists of several components, including data acquisition and wrangling, data computation using decision trees, and data visualization through a graphical user interface (GUI). The data acquisition process involves web scraping stock information from Yahoo Finance and storing it in a CSV file. The computed scores are based on industry-standard formulas sourced from reputable financial sources like Investopedia and The Motley Fool.

The GUI, implemented using the Pygame module, provides an interactive interface for users to input their preferences and view the recommended stocks. Users can specify preferences by selecting checkboxes related to stock attributes and sectors. The application then generates a decision tree based on the user's preferences and displays the recommended stocks along with detailed information about each stock.

The Stock Recommender project aims to simplify the stock market investment process and assist both beginners and experienced investors in making informed decisions. By leveraging comprehensive stock data and providing clear recommendations, the project offers a valuable tool for users to navigate the complexities of the stock market and achieve their investment goals.
